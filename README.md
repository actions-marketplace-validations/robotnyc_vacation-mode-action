# Vacation Mode JavaScript Action

This action helps maintainers of open source projects go on vacation and take mental health breaks by limiting community interactions within a repository. During this time, commenting, opening issues, or creating pull requests will be limited to a defined group.

This action uses the [interaction limit feature](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository). The issue with this feature is it only can be enabled for 24 hours. This action works around this _limitation_ in a way that hopefully makes it easier for the project maintainer and for the community.

Inspired by [@mrdoob](https://github.com/mrdoob)'s, maintainer of [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), feature request https://twitter.com/mrdoob/status/1305989856368234496 .

## Usage

1. Create an issue with a title that contains "vacation". For example, "ðŸŒ´ On Vacation Next Week".
1. Pin the issue so your community can clearly see that you are on vacation.
1. Include a description/out-of-office note in the issue explaining to your community why their interactions will be limited. See below for an example.

_Dear community, as the maintainer of this project, I have put the repository in "vacation mode" so that I can take a much needed and deserved break without worrying about tasks piling up while I recharge. I hope you can understand the need to take this action and not just "turn off notifications". Anyone who has experienced a company wide shutdown would understand, that it's much easier to disconnect from work when everyone does at the same time._

_Know that your contributions are valuable and appreciated, so please subscribe to this issue and get notified when I'm back and ready to resume actively maintaining this project._

## Inputs

### `limit-group`

Groups are defines as follows:
* Limit to **existing users**: Limits activity for users with accounts that are less than 24 hours old who do not have prior contributions and are not collaborators.
* Limit to prior **contributors**: Limits activity for users who have not previously contributed and are not collaborators.
* Limit to repository **collaborators**: Limits activity for users who do not have write access or are not collaborators.

**Required** Must be one of: `existing_users`, `contributors_only`, or `collaborators_only`. Default `"collaborators_only"`.

### `personal-access-token`

A personal access token is required because the GitHub API token generated for actions does not include the `repo` scope necessary to control the repository interaction limits.

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and create a personal access token named `vacation-mode` (name is not important) with the `repo` scope.
1. Copy the token value.
1. Go to the repository secrets settings https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/settings/secrets.
1. Add a secret with the name `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and copied token value.

* GitHub API available scopes: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes
* GitHub API Actions scopes: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#permissions-for-the-github_token
